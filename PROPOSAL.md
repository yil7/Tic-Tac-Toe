# Chris's final Project proposal - CS126

###What project you want to do?

I want to make a 2D shooting adventure game using cinder. The specific gameplay introduces a cartoon man walk in different rooms, and can use firearms to shoot bullets, and some monsters will go to attack the player.
I will use solidRect in cinder to create walls and obstacles, use mouse move in cinder to control the player's movement, and use particles to complete the bullet design. And use json file to load the information of each room.


###What background knowledge do you have on this kind of project, and why do you want to do this project? (Put another way, in what way will you be motivated to see this project to completion?)

I grew up playing shooting games, including csgo, jedi survival, fortnite, etc., but my skills don't support me to make such a fine game. So I chose to use simple methods to accomplish the basic features of a shooter

###A rough timeline of what will get accomplished and when (e.g, "By the end of Week 2, I will have implemented XYZ and will start working on ABC")
First in week1 I will try to get the scene done first, that is, the wall and the room.

In week2 I will design the movement of people and the firing of bullets, and the mind of the monster.


###If you were to finish the project early, what extra "stretch goals" could you implement?

Maybe I can implement more gun's, or more rooms to make the game's diversity more comprehensive.
Or some good Algorithm like BFS or DFS to find the shortest path to the end room.
Or add some cool magic to kill monsters quickly.
